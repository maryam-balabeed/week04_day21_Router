<h2 className="h0">About us</h2>
<hr className="hr0"  />
<p className="p0">Amazon works hard to delight our customers every day, and we want you to have peace of mind when shopping for products in our store including items sold by third-party sellers.

    Amazon’s longstanding A-to-z Guarantee protects you when you buy items that are sold and fulfilled by a third-party seller. It covers both the timely delivery and condition of your items. If you're not happy with either and can’t resolve the issue directly with the seller, you can make a claim directly to Amazon for a refund.
    
    We are continually looking for new ways to innovate for you, and this year we expanded our A-to-z Guarantee to include a process for resolving personal injury.</p>
